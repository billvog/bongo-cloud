# Bongo Cloud

Bongo Cloud, the cloud storage solution for the 21st Century, is a product of comedy.

The idea came from an old laptop that was laying dusted in the cellar without serving a purpose. So, I thought it would be interesting if I would turn that old laptop in a cloud storage server.

In the meantime, I was pretty interested in learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) with [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

The comedy part lies in the branding of _Bongo Cloud_. There is a single plan for all users that's free, and lets them (users) share the 250 GB disk of the laptop.

### Features

The app implements the following:
 - Custom user authentication with JWT, middlewares for refreshing and validating tokens.
 - Filesystem with folders.
 - Sharing system, to let users share files with some or all users.
 - Modern and simple-to-use user interface built with plain React.

### Deployment

Bongo Cloud was successfully hosted in my home network, using tools like Dynamic DNS services to bind a static IP to my dynamic one, under the domain bongo-cloud.ga.
